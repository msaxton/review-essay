### What is a review essay?

A review essay is a critical examination of 2-4 sources which cover the same topic or are thematically linked.

Review essays are NOT summaries or book reports.


### How do I write a review essay?

#### Gather your sources
* Sources should be relatively recent.
* Sources should be topically coherent or thematically linked.
* Bonus: Sources that are in conversation with one another. 

#### Critically engage your sources
* What thesis is being put forward by each source?
* Are there major themes?
* Identify 2-4 major themes for each source

#### Organize your thoughts
* What are the dominant themes across all your sources?
* Pose a question to your sources.
* What might author A say to author B on the topic? How would author C respond?
* Impose your own intellectual framework on the sources.

#### Structure your essay
